<h1>3. General Questions</h1>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q1">Q1: What's to worry about?</A></H2>

Unfortunately, there's a lot to worry about.  There are security risks
that affect Web servers, the local area networks that host Web sites,
and even innocent users of Web browsers.

<p>

The risks are most severe from the Webmaster's perspective.  The
moment you install a Web server at your site, you've opened a window
into your local network that the entire Internet can peer through.
Most visitors are content to window shop, but a few will try to to
peek at things you don't intend for public consumption.  Others, not
content with looking without touching, will attempt to force the
window open and crawl in.  The results can range from the merely
embarassing, for instance the discovery one morning that your site's
home page has been replaced by an obscene parody, to the damaging, for
example the theft of your entire database of customer information.

<p>

It's a maxim in system security circles that buggy software opens up
security holes.  It's a maxim in software development circles that
large, complex programs contain bugs.  Unfortunately, Web servers are
large, complex programs that can (and in some cases have been proven
to) contain security holes.  Furthermore, the open architecture of Web
servers allows arbitrary CGI scripts to be executed on the server's
side of the connection in response to remote requests.  Any CGI script
installed at your site may contain bugs, and every such bug is a
potential security hole.

<p>

From the point of view of the network administrator, a Web server
represents yet another potential hole in your local network's
security.  The general goal of network security is to keep strangers
out.  Yet the point of a Web site is to provide the world with
controlled access to your network.  Drawing the line can be difficult.
A poorly configured Web server can punch a hole in the most carefully
designed firewall system.  A poorly configured firewall can make a Web
site impossible to use.  Things get particularly complicated in an
intranet environment, where the Web server must typically be
configured to recognize and authenticate various groups of users, each
with distinct access privileges.

<p>

To the end-user, Web surfing feels both safe and anonymous.  It's not.
Active content, such as ActiveX controls and Java applets, introduces
the possibility that Web browsing will introduce viruses or other
malicious software into the user's system.  Active content also has
implications for the network administrator, insofar as Web browsers
provide a pathway for malicious software to bypass the firewall system
and enter the local area network.  Even without active content, the
very act of browsing leaves an electronic record of the user's surfing
history, from which unscrupulous individuals can reconstruct a very
accurate profile of the user's tastes and habits.

<p>

Finally, both end-users and Web administrators need to worry about the
confidentiality of the data transmitted across the Web.  The TCP/IP
protocol was not designed with security in mind; hence it is
vulnerable to network eavesdropping.  When confidential documents are
transmitted from the Web server to the browser, or when the end-user
sends private information back to the server inside a fill-out form,
someone may be listening in.

<hr>

<p>
<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q2">Q2: Exactly what security risks are we talking about?</A></H2>

There are basically three overlapping types of risk:

<OL>

  <li>Bugs or misconfiguration problems in the Web server that allow
      unauthorized remote users to:
      <ul>
	<li>Steal confidential documents not intended for their eyes.
	<li>Execute commands on the server host machine, allowing them
	    to modify the system.
	<li>Gain information about the Web server's host machine that
	    will allow them to break into the system.
	<li>Launch denial-of-service attacks, rendering the machine
	    temporarily unusable.
      </ul>

  <li>Browser-side risks, including:
      <ul>
	<li>Active content that crashes the browser, damages the
	    user's system, breaches the user's privacy, or merely
	    creates an annoyance.
	<li>The misuse of personal information knowingly or unkowingly
	    provided by the end-user.
      </ul>

  <li>Interception of network data sent from browser to server or vice
      versa via network eavesdropping.  Eavesdroppers can operate from
      any point on the pathway between browser and server including:
      <ul>
	<li>The network on the browser's side of the connection.
	<li>The network on the server's side of the connection
	    (including intranets).
	<li>The end-user's Internet service provider (ISP).
	<li>The server's ISP.
	<li>Either ISPs' regional access provider.
      </ul>
</OL>

<p>

It's important to realize that "secure" browsers and servers are only
designed to protect confidential information against network
eavesdropping.  Without system security on both browser and server
sides, confidential documents are vulnerable to interception.

<p>

Protecting against network eavesdropping and system security are the
subject of sections 1 to 5 of this document.  Client-side security is
covered in sections 6 and 7.  Section 8 deals with security alerts for
specific Web servers.

<HR>

<p>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q3">Q3: Are some operating systems more secure to use as platforms for Web
servers than others?</A></H2>

<p>

The answer is yes, although the Unix and NT communities may not like
to hear it.  In general, the more powerful and flexible the operating
system, the more open it is for attack through its Web (and other)
servers.

<p>

Unix systems, with their large number of built-in servers, services,
scripting languages, and interpreters, are particularly vulnerable to
attack because there are simply so many portals of entry for hackers
to exploit.  Less capable systems, such as Macintoshes and
special-purpose Web server boxes, are less easy to exploit.  The
safest Web site is a bare-bones Macintosh running a bare-bones Web
server.  See <a href="wwwsf3.html#Q20">Servers, Q20</a> for details.

<p>

In the real world, of course, many sites will want to run a Windows NT
or Unix server in order to gain the performance advantage of a
multitasking operating system and the benefits of database and
middleware connectivity .  Security holes have been found in both Unix
and Windows NT server systems, and new security holes are being found
on a regular basis.  On the whole Windows NT systems seem to be more
vulnerable at the current time, partly the OS is relatively new and
the big bugs haven't been shaken out, and partly because the NT file
system and user account system are highly complex and difficult to
configure correctly.

<p>

If you have configured your system correctly and are compulsive about
applying your vendor's security patches promptly, a typical Unix
system will be more secure than a typical NT system.  However, you
also have to factor in the experience of the people running the server
host and software.  A Unix system administered by a novice system
administrator will be far less secure than an NT system set up by a
seasoned Windows NT system administrator.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q4">Q4: Are some Web server software programs more secure than others?</A></H2>

Again, the answer is yes, although it would be foolhardy to give
specific recommendations on this point.  As a rule of thumb, the more
features a server offers, the more likely it is to contain security
holes.  Simple servers that do little more than make static files
available for requests are probably safer than complex servers that
offer such features as on-the-fly directory listings, CGI script
execution, server-side include processing, and scripted error
handling.

<p>
Version 1.3 of NCSA's Unix server contains a serious known security
hole.  Discovered in March of 1995, this hole allows outsiders to
execute arbitrary commands on the server host.  If you have a version
1.3 httpd binary whose creation date is earlier than March 1995 don't
use it!  Replace it with the patched 1.3 server (available at
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/</A>) or with
version 1.4 or higher (available at the same site).  The
Apache plug-in replacement for NCSA (<A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.com/apache/info.html">http://www.hyperreal.com/apache/info.html</A>) is also free of this bug.

<p>
Servers also vary in their ability to restrict browser access to
individual documents or portions of the document tree.  Some servers
provide no restriction at all, while others allow you to restrict
access to directories based on the IP address of the browser or to
users who can provide the correct password.  A few servers, primarily
commercial ones (e.g. Netsite Commerce Server, Open Market), provide
data encryption as well.

<p>
The WN server, by John Franks, deserves special mention in this regard
because its design is distinctively different from other Web servers.
While most servers take a permissive attitude to file distribution,
allowing any document in the document root to be transferred unless it
is specifically forbidden, WN takes a restrictive stance.  The server
will not transfer a file unless it has been explicitly placed on a
list of allowed documents.  On-the-fly directory listings and other
"promiscuous" features are also disallowed.  Information on WN's
security features can be found in its online documentation at:

<p>
<A HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/security.html">http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/security.html</A>

<p>
A table comparing the features of a large number of commercial,
freeware and public domain servers has been put together by the
WebCompare site:

  <A HREF="http://www.webcompare.com/">http://www.webcompare.com/</A>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q5">Q5: Are CGI scripts insecure?</A></H2>

CGI scripts are a major source of security holes.  Although the CGI
(Common Gateway Interface) protocol is not inherently insecure, CGI
scripts must be written with just as much care as the server
itself. Unfortunately some scripts fall short of this standard and
trusting Web administrators install them at their sites without
realizing the problems.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q6">Q6: Are server-side includes insecure?</A></H2>

<p>
Server side includes, snippets of server directives embedded in HTML
documents, are another potential hole.  A subset of the directives
available in server-side includes instruct the server to execute
arbitrary system commands and CGI scripts.  Unless the author is aware
of the potential problems it's easy to introduce unintentional side
effects.  Unfortunately, HTML files containing dangerous server-side
includes are seductively easy to write.

<p>

Some servers, including Apache and NCSA, allow the Web master to
selectively disable the types of includes that can execute arbitrary
commands.  See <a href="wwwsf3.html#SVR-Q15">Q10</a> for more details.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q7">Q7: What general security precautions should I take?</A></H2>

If you are a Webmaster, system administrator, or are otherwise
involved with the administration of a network, the single most
important step you can take to increase your site's security is to
create a written security policy.  This security policy should
succinctly lay out your organization's policies with regard to:

<ul>
  <li>who is allowed to use the system
  <li>when they are allowed to use it
  <li>what they are allowed to do (different groups may be granted
      different levels of access)
  <li>procedures for granting access to the system
  <li>procedures for revoking access (e.g. when an employee leaves)
  <li>what constitutes acceptable use of the system
  <li>remote and local login methods
  <li>system monitoring procedures
  <li>protocols for responding to suspected security breaches
</ul>

This policy need not be anything fancy.  It need only be a succinct
summary of how the information system work, reflecting your
organization's technological and political realities.  There are
several benefits to having a written security policy:

<ol>
  <li>You yourself will understand what is and is not permitted on the
      system.  If you don't have a clear picture of what is permitted,
      you can never be sure when a violation has occurred.
  <li>Others in your organization will understand what the security
      policy is.  The written policy raises the level of security
      consciousness, and provides a focal point for discussion.
  <li>The security policy serves as a requirements document against
      which technical solutions can be judged.  This helps guard
      against the "buy first, ask questions later" syndrome.
  <li>The policy may help bolster your legal case should you ever need
      to prosecute for a security violation.
</ol>

More suggestions for formulating a security policy can be found in <a
href="wwwsf7.html#general_security">the general Internet security
reference works</a> listed at the end of this document.

<p>

For Web servers running on Unix and NT systems, here are some general
security precautions to take:

<OL>
  <LI> Limit the number of login accounts available on the machine.
Delete inactive users.

      <p>

  <LI> Make sure that people with login privileges choose good passwords.
The Crack program will help you detect poorly-chosen passwords:

           http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~crypto/download/c50-faq.html
        </A>

<p>
  <li>Turn off unused services.  For example, if you don't need to run
      FTP on the Web server host, get rid of the ftp software.
      Likewise for tftp, sendmail, gopher, NIS (network information
      services) clients, NFS (networked file system), finger, systat, and
      anything else that might be hanging around.  Check the file
      /etc/inetd.conf (Unix) or <cite>Service Manager</cite> for a
      list of servers that may be lurking.  Deactivate any that you
      don't use.

<p>

  <li>Remove shells and interpreters that you don't absolutely need.  For
      example, if you don't run any Perl-based CGI scripts, remove the Perl
      interpreter.

<p>

  <li>Check both the system and Web logs regularly for suspicious
      activity.  The program Tripwire (Unix), and Internet Security Scanner
      (Unix &amp; NT) are helpful for detecting this type of activity:

    <dl>
      <dt>
      <dt>Tripwire
      <dd>      <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ids/tripwire/">
      ftp://ftp.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ids/tripwire/</A>
      <dt>Internet Security Scanner
      <dd><a href="http://www.iss.net">http://www.iss.net</a>
    </dl>
      More on scanning Web logs for suspicious activity below.

      <p>

  <li> Make sure that permissions are set correctly on system files, to
    discourage tampering.  On Unix systems, the program COPS is useful
      for this:

    <blockquote>
   <A HREF="http://www.fish.com/cops/">
       http://www.fish.com/cops/
   </A>
    </blockquote>

      On Windows NT, give Midwestern Commerce's Administrator Assistant
      Toolkit a try:

      <blockquote>
      <a href="http://www.ntsecurity.com">http://www.ntsecurity.com</a>
      </blockquote>


</OL>

Be alert to the possibility that a _local_ user can accidentally make
a change to the Web server configuration file or the document tree
that opens up a security hole.  You should set file permissions in the
document and server root directories such that only trusted local
users can make changes.  Many sites create a "www" group to which
trusted Web authors are added.  The document root is made writable
only by members of this group.  To increase security further, the
server root where vital configuration files are kept, is made writable
only by the official Web administrator.  Many sites create a "www"
user for this purpose.
