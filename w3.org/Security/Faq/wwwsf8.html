Server-Side Include Source Code Vulnerable, June 25, 1998</H4>
Programmers at <A HREF="http://www.sddt.com">San Diego Source,</A> the
online news service of the <I>San Diego Daily Transcript</I> have discovered
that by appending certain characters to the end of the URL that refers
to a server-side include file, a remote user can recover the source code
for the file, disclosing proprietary information, copyrighted source code,
and even user names and passwords used to log into databases. In addition
to affecting server-side includes, this bug affects such popular products
as Allaire Cold Fusion, Microsoft Active Server Pages, and PHP.
<P>Details of the exploit have not been published, but you can find a longer
description in the original article at <A HREF="http://www.sddt.com/files/library/98/06/25/tbc.html">http://www.sddt.com/files/library/98/06/25/tbc.html</A>.
<P>Netscape is reportedly working on a fix. Please visit the <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape
site</A> for possible patches. If you use server-side includes, you are
urged to upgrade as soon as a patch becomes available.
<P><A HREF="#Q74">O'Reilly's WebSite and WebSite Professional servers</A>
are also vulnerable to this bug. Microsoft IIS servers do not appear to
be.
<H4>
Back Door Access to Protected Files, January 8, 1998</H4>
Netscape Enterprise Server 3.0 and FastTrack 3.01 both contain a bug that
allows unauthorized remote users to fetch documents that are protected
by IP address and password. This bug affects any file that does <I>not</I>
use the standard DOS 8.3 naming convention. For example, if the document
is named <I>somelongfile.htm</I>, then the unscrupulous user can ask for
the file SOMEF~1.HTM, which is the mangled DOS equivalent of the file name.
Even though the document may be password protected, this fetch will succeed.
<P>This bug is fixed in Enterprise Server 3.5.1 or higher (see <A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/kb/server/980522-69.html">this
technical note</A>). It is unclear whether there is a patch available for
the FastTrack server, however, which was still at version 3.01 as of June
30, 1998.
<P>The same bug is present in the <A HREF="#Q76">Microsoft IIS server</A>.
O'Reilly's WebSite Professional are reportedly free of the problem
<H4>
Perl CGI Scripts are Often Misconfigured, 1997</H4>
The Netscape server does not use the NT File Manager's associations between
file extensions and applications. Thus, even though you may have associated
the extension .pl with the perl interpreter, perl scripts aren't recognized
as such when placed in the cgi-bin directory. Until very recently, a Netscape
technical note recommended placing perl.exe into cgi-bin and referring
to your scripts as <TT>/cgi-bin/perl.exe?&amp;my_script.pl</TT>.
<P>Unfortunately this technique allows anyone on the Internet to execute
an arbitrary set of Perl commands on your server by invoking such scripts
as
<TT>/cgi-bin/perl.exe?&amp;-e+unlink+%3C*%3E</TT> (when run, this URL
removes every file in the server's current directory). This is
<I>not a
good idea</I>. A current Netscape technical note suggests encapsulating
your Perl scripts in a .bat file. However, because of a related problem
with batch scripts, this is no safer.
<P>Because the EMWACS, Purveyor and WebSite NT servers all use the File
Manager extension associations, you can execute perl scripts on these servers
without placing perl.exe into cgi-bin. They are safe from this bug.
<H4>
<A NAME="bat_files"></A>DOS .bat files are Insecure, February, 1996</H4>
Older versions the Netscape servers (both the <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_commun.html">Netscape
Communications Server version 1.12</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_commerce.html">Netscape
Commerce Server version 1.0</A>) have two problems involving the handling
of CGI scripts. One of these problems is also shared by the
<A HREF="#Q74">WebSite
Server</A>.
<P>Ian Redfern<A HREF="mailto:redferni@logica.com">redferni@logica.com</A>)
has discovered that a similar hole exists in the processing of CGI scripts
implemented as .bat files. The following is excerpted from his e-mail describing
the problem:
<PRE>  Consider test.bat:

    @echo off
    echo Content-type: text/plain
    echo
    echo Hello World!

  If this is called as "/cgi-bin/test.bat?&amp;dir" you get the output
  of the CGI program, followed by a directory listing.

  It appears that the server is doing system("test.bat &amp;dir") which
  the command interpreter is handling (not unreasonably) in the
  same way /bin/sh would - execute it, and if things go OK,
  execute the dir command.</PRE>

Server-Side Include Source Code Vulnerable, June 25, 1998</H4>
Programmers at <A HREF="http://www.sddt.com">San Diego Source,</A> the
online news service of the <I>San Diego Daily Transcript</I> have discovered
that by appending certain characters to the end of the URL that refers

<P>O'Reilly has announced that a fix will be available in WebSite and WebSite
Professional version 2.3. If you use server-side includes, you should strongly
consider upgrading.
<P><A HREF="#Q73">Windows-based Netscape servers </A>are also vulnerable

<H4>
.BAT Scripts Vulnerable (1996)</H4>
<A HREF="http://website.ora.com/">WebSite</A> versions 1.1b and earlier
have the same problem with <A HREF="#bat_files">DOS .bat files</A> that
Netscape does. However because WebSite supports three different types of
CGI scripting interfaces (native Windows, Standard CGI for Perl scripts,
and the rarely used DOS .bat file interface), the recommended action is
to turn off the server's support for DOS CGI scripts. This will not affect
the server's ability to run Visual Basic, Perl, or C scripts.
<P><B>This hole has been fixed in version 1.1c.</B> You should upgrade
to this version with the patch provided at the WebSite home page.
<P>Detailed information on the actions necessary to close the WebSite .bat

<A NAME="Q75"></A>Q75: Are there any known security problems with the Purveyor
Server for Windows NT?</H3>
The Purveyor Web server, all versions, is vulnerable to the same bug that
allows the source code for server-side include files to be revealed. See
the description of this bug in the section on <A HREF="#Q73">Netscape Enterprise
Server</A> for more details. Support for Purveyor was discontinued in 1997,
so no fix or upgrade is available. Your choices are to avoid using server-side
includes, or to change server software completely.
<H3>
<A NAME="Q76"></A>Q76: Are there any known security problems with the Microsoft's
IIS Web Server?</H3>

<H4>
Back Door Access to Protected Files, January 8, 1998</H4>
Microsoft Internet Information Server and Personal Web Server versions
4.0 and earlier contain a bug that allows unauthorized remote users to
fetch documents that are restricted by IP address or SSL use. This bug
affects any file that does <I>not</I> use the standard DOS 8.3 naming convention.
For example, if the document is named
<I>somelongfile.htm</I>, then the
unscrupulous user can ask for the file SOMEF~1.HTM, which is the mangled
DOS equivalent of the file name. Even though the document may be restricted,
this fetch will succeed. Password protection, which is accomplished through
file system access control lists, is not affected by this bug, although
other file-specific settings, such as PICS rating, are.
<P>A patch is available on <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/">Microsoft's
security pages</A>. Newer versions of IIS are free of the problem.
<P>The same bug is present in the <A HREF="#Q73">Netscape Enterprise and
Commerce servers</A>. Recent versions of WebSite Professional are reportedly
free of the problem
<H4>
.BAT CGI Script Hole, March 1996</H4>
Versions of the Microsoft IIS server downloaded prior to 3/5/96 contain
the same .BAT file bug that appears in other NT-based servers. In fact
the problem is worse than on other servers because .BAT CGI scripts doesn't
even have to be installed on the server for a malicious remote user to
invoke any arbitrary set of DOS commands on your server!
<P>Microsoft has released a patch for this bug, available at
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv">http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv</A>.
In addition, all copies of the IIS server downloaded after 3/5/96 should
be free of this bug. If you use this server, you should check the creation
date of your server binary and upgrade it if necessary.
<P>Versions of Microsoft IIS through 3.0 are vulnerable to a bug that allows
remote users to download and read the <B>contents</B> of executable scripts,
potentially learning sensitive information about the local network configuration,
the name of databases, or the algorithm used to calculate vendor discounts.
This bug appears whenever a script-mapped file is placed in a directory
that has both execute and read permissions. Remote users can download the
script itself simply by placing additional periods at the end of its URL.
To avoid this bug, turn off read permissions in any directory that contains
scripts. Alternatively, download the patch provided by Microsoft at:

<H4>
June 25, 1997 -- denial of service attack</H4>
IIS version 3.0 is vulnerable to a simple denial of service attack. By
sending a long URL of a particular length to an IIS server, anyone on the
Internet can cause the Web server to crash. The server will need to be
restarted manually in order to resume Web services. A variety of Perl and
Java programs that exploit this bug are floating around the Internet, and
actual attacks have been reported.
<P>The exact length of the URL that is required to cause the crash varies
from server to server, and depends on such issues as memory usage. The
magic length is generally around 8192 characters in length, suggesting
that the problem is a memory buffer overflow. In the past such problems
have often been exploited by knowledgeable hackers to execute remote commands
on the server, so this bug is potentially more than annoyance.
<P>A patch is available from Microsoft at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/iis-fix">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/iis-fix</A>

<A NAME="Q77"></A>Q77: Are there any known security problems with Sun Microsystem's
JavaWebServer for Windows NT?</H3>

<H4>
Servlet Source Code Vulnerable to Disclosure, June 29, 1998</H4>
The JavaWebServer is able to compile and execute Java class files in a
manner similar to CGI scripts (but much more efficiently). These small
Java programs are called "servlets."
<P>The Windows NT version of <A HREF="http://jserv.java.sun.com/products/webserver/index.html">JavaWebServer</A>
is vulnerable to a bug that allows the source code for Java servlets to
be downloaded by remote users. This bug is similar to ones identified for
Windows NT versions of <A HREF="#Q74">O'Reilly WebSite Professional</A>
and <A HREF="#Q73">Netscape Enterprise Server</A>. By appending certain
characters to the end of a servlet's URL, a remote user can fool the server
into sending him the compiled servlet, which can then be decompiled by
a product such as Mocha. Since servlets may contain proprietary code, trade
secrets or even database access passwords, this is a significant problem.
<P>Sun has not yet announced a fix for this problem. Check their Web site
for details. More information can be found at <A HREF="http://www.sddt.com/files/library/98/06/29/tbd.html">http://www.sddt.com/files/library/98/06/29/tbd.html</A>

<A NAME="Q78"></A>Q78: Are there any known security problems with the MetaInfo
MetaWeb Server?</H3>

<H4>
Physical Path not Protected, June 30, 1998</H4>
MetaInfo (<A HREF="http://www.metainfo.com">www.metainfo.com</A>) produces
a number of NT products, including a port of the Unix Sendmail program
and a DHCP/DNS server. It provides a Web server, called MetaWeb, as a user-friendly
front end to its administration tools for these products. At the time this
was written, MetaWeb was at version 3.1.
<P>According to Jeff Forristal, who discovered the bug, MetaWeb is vulnerable
to the "double-dot" problem that plagued early versions of the Microsoft
IIS server. By including ".." pairs in the URL path, the server can be
tricked into giving access to directories outside the Web document root,
including documents in the Windows system directory. This allows password
files and other confidential information to be retrieved. Worse, a variant
of this attack also gives remote users the ability to run any executable
binary that happens to be installed on the server machine.
<P>MetaWeb has not yet made an upgrade or patch available. You are urged
to upgrade when a fix does become available. A good short-term solution
is to disable remote administration via the Web interface.
<P>More information about the MetaInfo bug may be posted <A HREF="http://www.forristech.com">Jeff
Forristal's site</A>.

<A NAME="Q79"></A>Q79: Are there any known security problems with NCSA
httpd?</H3>
Versions of <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/">NCSA httpd</A>
prior to 1.4 contain a serious security hole relating to a fixed-size string
buffer. Remote users could break into systems running this server by requesting
an extremely long URL. Although this bug has been well publicized for more
than a year, many sites are still running unsafe versions of the server.
The current version of the software, version 1.5, does not suffer from
this bug and is available at the link given at the beginning of this paragraph.
<P><A NAME="util.c"></A>Recently it has come to light that example C code
(<TT>cgi_src/util.c</TT>) long distributed with the NCSA httpd as an example
of how to write safe CGI scripts ommitted the newline character from the
list of characters that are shouldn't be passed to shells. This ommission
introduces a serious bug into any CGI scripts that were built on top of
this example code: a remote user can exploit this bug to force the CGI
script to execute any arbitrary Unix command. This is another example of
the <A HREF="#bad_shell">dangers of executing shell commands</A> from CGI
scripts.
<P>In addition, the NCSA server source code tree itself contains the same
bug (versions 1.5a and earlier). The faulty subroutine is identical, but
in this case is found in the file
<TT>src/util.c</TT> as opposed to <TT>cgi_src/util.c</TT>.
After looking through the server source code, I haven't found a place where
a user-provided string is passed to a shell after being processed by this
subroutine, so I don't <I>think</I> this represents an actual security hole.
However, it's best to apply the patch shown below to be safe.
<P>The Apache server, versions 1.02 and earlier, also contains this hole
in both its <TT>cgi_src</TT> and <TT>src/</TT> subdirectories. It's not
unlikely that the same problem is present in other derivatives of the NCSA
source code.
<P>The patch to fix the holes in the two <TT>util.c</TT> files is simple.
"phf" and any CGI scripts that use this library should be recompiled after
applying this patch (the GNU patch program can be found at <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/patch-2.1.tar.gz">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/patch-2.1.tar.gz</A>).
You should apply this patch twice, once while inside the cgi_src/ subdirectory,
and once within the src/ directory itself:
<PRE>   tulip% cd ~www/ncsa/cgi_src
   tulip% patch -f &lt; ../util.patch
   tulip% cd ../src
   tulip% patch -f &lt; ../util.patch

<H3>
<A NAME="Q80"></A>Q80: Are there any known security problems with Apache
httpd?</H3>
Versions of Apache httpd prior to 1.2.5 contain several programming errors
that present moderate security risks. Users who have local access to the
server machine (e.g. Web authors), can carefully craft HTML files which,
when fetched, will give the user the ability to execute Unix commands with
Web server user permissions. Since local users usually already have as
much, if not more, access to the system as the Web server, this does not
present a major risk, but it may be of concern to ISP's who provide Web
hosting services to untrusted authors. Apache version 1.2.5 is free of
these bugs; upgrade at your earliest convenience. If you are using a 1.3
beta version of Apache, you may apply a patch located atthe Apache site,
or await the release of 1.3b4.
<P>Apache servers prior to 1.1.3 contain two security holes which are of
far more concern. The first hole affects servers compiled with the "mod_cookies"
module. Servers compiled with this module contain a vulnerability that
allows remote users to send the server extremely long cookies and overrun
the program stack, potentially allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.
Because this gives remote users access to the server host, it is a far
greater vulnerability than the holes discussed above, which only can be
exploited by local users.
<P>The second problem with 1.1.1 affects automatic directory listings.
Ordinarily, a remote user cannot obtain a directory listing if the directory
contains a "welcome page", such as "index.html". A bug causes this check
to fail under certain circumstances, allowing the remote user to see the
contents of the directory even if the welcome page is present. This hole
is less serious than the first one, but is still a potential information
leak.

<A NAME="Q81"></A>Q81: Are there any known security problems with the Netscape
Servers?</H3>

Netscape Enterprise server versions 3.6sp2 and earlier, as well as
FastTrack server versions 3.01 and earlier contain a buffer overflow
bug that can allow a remote user to gain shell access to the server
machine.  More information on this problem, as well as pointers to
patches, can be found at <a
href="http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/j-062.shtml">http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/j-062.shtml</a>.

<P>There have also been two well-publicized recent episodes in which
the system used by the <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Secure Commerce Server</A> to encrypt sensitive communications was
cracked. In the first episode, a single message encrypted with
Netscape's less secure 40-bit encryption key was cracked by brute
force using a network of workstations.  The 128-bit key used for
communications within the U.S. and Canada is considered immune from
this type of attack.  <P>In the second episode, it was found that the
random number generator used within the server to generate encryption
keys was relatively predictable, allowing a cracking program to
quickly guess at the correct key. This hole has been closed in the
recent releases of the software, and you should upgrade to the current
version if you rely on encryption for secure communications.  Both the
server <I>and</I> the browser need to be upgraded in order to
completely close this hole. See <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/random_seed_security.html">http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/random_seed_security.html</A>
for details.  <H3>

<A NAME="Q82"></A>Q82: Are there any known security problems with the Lotus
Domino Go Server?</H3>
Bill Jones <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@fccj.cc.fl.us">&lt;webmaster@fccj.cc.fl.us></A>
reports that older versions of Lotus Domino Go, formerly known as IBM Internet
Connection Server (ICS), contained a security hole in directory browsing.
When directory browsing is set to "fancy", a potential hacker can browse
backward through the directory tree all the way up to root ("/"). Thus,
private system files and other documents are exposed to interception. This
bug was present in versions 1.0 through 2.0 of ICS, and affected both the
AIX and OS/2 Warp versions.
<P>According to Richard L. Gray (<A HREF="mailto:rlgray@us.ibm.com>">rlgray@us.ibm.com></A>)
of IBM, all known problems have been fixed in versions 4.2.1.3 and higher.
Lotus Domino Go also now runs on Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/390, HPUX and
Solaris systems.

<A NAME="Q83"></A>Q83: Are there any known security problems with the WN
Server?</H3>
The <A HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu">WN server</A> is free of any known
security holes. As explained in <A HREF="wwwsf1.html#Q6">Q6</A> it contains
several features that lessen the chance that security will be breached
by improper server configuration.
<H2>
Macintosh Servers</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="Q84"></A>Q84: Are there any known security problems with WebStar?</H3>
There is a gaping hole in WebSTAR's handling of log files. If you install
WebSTAR using the default configuration, the server's log file will be
located within the document tree. Anyone on the Internet can download the
entire server log and review all remote accesses to the server simply by
requesting the URL "http://your.site/WebSTAR%20LOG ". As discussed in <A HREF="wwwsf6.html">Server
Logs and Privacy</A>, this is a violation of users' expectation to privacy.
Use WebSTAR's administrative tool to change the location of the log file
to some place outside the document tree.
<P>As far as the security of the WebSTAR server itself goes, there is reason
to think that WebSTAR is more secure than its Unix and Windows counterparts.
Because the Macintosh does not have a command shell, and because it does
not allow remote logins, it is reasonable to expect that the Mac is inherently
more secure than the other platforms. In fact this expectation has been
borne out so far: no specific security problems are known in either WebStar
or its shareware ancestor MacHTTP.
<P>In early 1996 a consortium of Macintosh Internet software development
companies, including StarNine, the developer of WebStar, posted a $10,000
reward to anyone who could read a password-protected Web page on a Macintosh
running WebStar software. As described in an article about the challenge
in <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/pages/TidBITS/TidBITS.html">Tidbits#317/04-Mar-96</A>,
after 45 days no one had stepped forward to claim the prize.
<P>Although one cannot easily "break in" to a Macintosh host in the conventional
way, potential security holes do exist:
<OL>
<LI>
Exploiting holes in the server to read files outside the official document
tree.</LI>

<LI>
Finding a way to crash the server.</LI>

<LI>
Exploiting holes in CGI scripts to execute AppleScript commands. This particularly
of concern for Perl scripts. All the caveats and warnings about <A HREF="wwwsf4.html">safe
scripting</A> apply.</LI>
</OL>
In fact, a repeat "Crack-a-Mac" challenge in 1997, sponsored by a Swedish
consulting company, was not so fortunate. In this case, a cracker was able
to break into the server and steal the protected page by exploiting bugs
in two server remote administration and editing add-ons. This emphasizes
the risk that you runs whenever you add CGI scripts, server modules, and
other extensions to Web servers. Details on the successful break-in, along
with links to patched server extensions, can be found at <A HREF="http://hacke.infinit.se/">http://hacke.infinit.se/</A>

<A NAME="Q87"></A>Q87: Are there any known security problems with Novell
WebServer?</H3>
If you are running Novell Webserver version 3.x and have the Web Server
Examples Toolkit v.2 installed, you have a major security hole. Users can
view any file on your system and download directory listings, possibly
gaining information needed to break into your system. The hole is in the
example CGI Perl script files.pl. Remove it from your /perl directory (typically
located in SYS:INW_WEB\SHARED\DOCS\LCGI\PERL5. Better yet, remove
<B>all</B>
CGI scripts that are not essential for the operation of your site.
