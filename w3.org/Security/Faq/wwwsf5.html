<a NAME="restrictions"></a>5. Protecting Confidential Documents at Your
Site</h1>

<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q1"></a>Q1: What types of access restrictions are available?</h2>
There are three types of access restriction available:
<ol>
<li>
Restriction by IP address, subnet, or domain</li>

<br>Individual documents or whole directories are protected in such a way
that only browsers connecting from certain IP (Internet) addresses, IP
subnets, or domains can access them.
<li>
Restriction by user name and password</li>

<br>Documents or directories are protected so that the remote user has
to provide a name and password in order to get access.
<li>
Encryption using public key cryptography</li>

<br>Both the request for the document and the document itself are encrypted
in such a way that the text cannot be read by anyone but the intended recipient.
Public key cryptography can also be used for reliable user verification.
See below.</ol>

<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q2"></a>Q2: How safe is restriction by IP address or domain
name?</h2>
Restriction by IP address is secure against casual nosiness but not against
a determined hacker. There are several ways around IP address restrictions.
With the proper equipment and software, a hacker can "spoof" his IP address,
making it seem as if he's connecting from a location different from his
real one. Nor is there any guarantee that the person contacting your server
from an authorized host is in fact the person you think he is. The remote
host may have been broken into and is being used as a front. To be safe,
IP address restriction must be combined with something that checks the
identity of the user, such as a check for user name and password.
<p>IP address restriction can be made much safer by running your server
behind a firewall machine that is capable of detecting and rejecting attempts
at spoofing IP addresses. Such detection works best for intercepting packets
from the outside world that claim to be from trusted machines on your internal
network.
<p>One thing to be aware of is that if a browser is set to use a proxy
server to fetch documents, then your server will only know about the IP
address of the proxy, not the real user's. This means that if the proxy
is in a trusted domain, anyone can use that proxy to access your site.
Unless you know that you can trust a particular proxy to do its own restriction,
don't add the IP address of a proxy (or a domain containing a proxy server)
to the list of authorized addresses.
<p>Restriction by host or domain name has the same risks as restriction
by IP address, but also suffers from the risk of "DNS spoofing", an attack
in which your server is temporarily fooled into thinking that a trusted
host name belongs to an alien IP address. To lessen that risk, some servers
can be configured to do an extra DNS lookup for each client. After translating
the IP address of the incoming request to a host name, the server uses
the DNS to translate from the host name back to the IP address. If the
two addresses don't match, the access is forbidden. <a href="#maximum_dns">See
below</a> for instructions on enabling this feature in NCSA's httpd
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q3"></a>Q3: How safe is restriction by user name and password?</h2>
Restriction by user name and password also has its problems. A password
is only good if it's chosen carefully. Too often users choose obvious passwords
like middle names, their birthday, their office phone number, or the name
of a favorite pet goldfish. These passwords can be guessed at, and WWW
servers, unlike Unix login programs, don't complain after repeated unsuccessful
guesses. A determined hacker can employ a password guessing program to
break in by brute force. You also should be alert to the possibility of
remote users sharing their user names and passwords. It is more secure
to use a combination of IP address restriction and password than to use
either of them alone.
<p>Another problem is that the password is vulnerable to interception as
it is transmitted from browser to server. It is not encrypted in any meaningful
way, so a hacker with the right hardware and software can pull it off the
Internet as it passes through. Furthermore, unlike a login session, in
which the password is passed over the Internet just once, a browser sends
the password each and every time it fetches a protected document. This
makes it easier for a hacker to intercept the transmitted data as it flows
across the Internet. To avoid this, you have to encrypt the data. See below.
<p>If you need to protect documents against _local_ users on the server's
host system, you'll need to run the server as something other than "nobody"
and to set the permissions of both the restricted documents and server
scripts so that they're not world readable. See Q9.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q4"></a>Q4: What is user authentication?</h2>
User verification is any system that for determining, and verifying, the
identity of a remote user. User name and password is a simple form of user
authentication. Public key cryptographic systems, described below, provide
a more sophisticated form authentication that uses an unforgeable electronic
signature.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q5"></a>Q5: How do I restrict access to documents by the IP
address or domain name of the remote browser?</h2>
The details are different for each server. See your server's documentation
for details. For servers based on NCSA httpd, you'll need to add a directory
control section to access.conf that looks something like this:
<PRE>
   &lt;Directory /full/path/to/directory&gt;


     &lt;Limit GET POST&gt;
       order mutual-failure
       deny from all
       allow from 192.198.2 .zoo.org
       allow from 18.157.0.5 stoat.outback.au
     &lt;/Limit&gt;

   &lt;/Directory&gt;
</PRE>

This will deny access to everybody but the indicated hosts (18.157.0.5
and stoat.outback.au), subnets (182.198.2) and domains (.zoo.org). Although
you can use either numeric IP addresses or host names, it's safer to use
the numeric form because this form of identification is less easily subverted
(<a href="#CON-Q1">Q1</a>).
<p>One way to increase the security of restriction by domain name is to
make sure that your server double-checks the results of its DNS lookups. <a NAME="maximum_dns"></a>You
can enable this feature in NCSA's httpd (and the related Apache server)
by making sure that the
<tt>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</tt> flag is set in the Makefile.
<p>For the CERN server, you'll need to declare a protection scheme with
the Protection directive, and associate it with a local URL using the Protect
directive. An entry in httpd.conf that limits access to certain domains
might look like this:

<pre>
   Protection LOCAL-USERS {

     GetMask @(*.capricorn.com, *.zoo.org, 18.157.0.5)
   }

   Protect /relative/path/to/directory/* LOCAL-USERS
</PRE>

<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q6"></a>Q6: How do I add new users and passwords?</h2>
Unix-based servers use password and group files similar to the like-named
Unix files. Although the format of these files are similar enough to allow
you to use the Unix versions for the Web server, this isn't a good idea.
You don't want to give a hacker who's guessed a Web password carte blanche
to log into the Unix host.
<p>Check your server documentation for the precise details of how to add
new users. For NCSA httpd, you can add a new user to the password file
using the htpasswd program that comes with the server software:

<pre>
   htpasswd /path/to/password/file username

</pre>

htpasswd will then prompt you for the password to use. The first time you
invoke htpasswd you must provide a -c flag to create the password file
from scratch.
<p>The CERN server comes with a slightly different program called htadm:
<pre>
   htadm -adduser /path/to/password/file username

</pre>

htadm will then prompt you for the new password.
<p>After you add all the authorized users, you can attach password protection
to the directories of your choice. In NCSA httpd and its derivatives, add
something like this to access.conf:
<PRE>
   &lt;Directory /full/path/to/protected/directory&gt;

     AuthName          name.of.your.server
     AuthType          Basic
     AuthUserFile      /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/passwd
     &lt;Limit GET POST&gt;
       require valid-user
     &lt;/Limit&gt;

&lt;/Directory&gt;
</PRE>

You'll need to replace AuthUserFile with the full path to the password
file. This type of protection can be combined with IP address restriction
as described in the previous section. See NCSA's online documentation (http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/)
or the author's book (<a href="http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/">How to
Set Up and Maintain a Web Site</a>) for more details.
<p>For the CERN server, the corresponding entry in httpd.conf looks like
this:
<PRE>
   Protection AUTHORIZED-USERS {
     AuthType     Basic
     ServerID     name.of.your.server
     PasswordFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/passwd
     GetMask      All
}
Protect /relative/path/to/directory/* AUTHORIZED-USERS
</PRE>
Again, see the documentation or the author's book for details.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q7"></a>Q7: Is there a CGI script to allow users to change their
passwords online?</h2>
There are several floating around. The one I use is a Perl script that
I wrote myself, <i>user_manage</i>. It works with the password and group
files used by the Apache, NCSA httpd, CERN and Netscape Unix servers, and
probably other Unix-based servers. Users can use it to safely change their
own passwords, and Web administrators can use it to add new users, manipulate
groups, and edit the privileges of existing users. You can find this script
at
<blockquote><a href="http://stein.cshl.org/~lstein/user_manage/">http://stein.cshl.org/~lstein/user_manage/</a></blockquote>
Bill Jones has written a multi-purpose script called
<i>WebPass</i>. In
addition to allowing users to change their Web passwords, they can also
change their POP, log-in and news passwords, if they have them. It uses
a combination of Perl and Expect to do its magic. You can find it at:
<blockquote><a href="http://web.fccj.org/~wcjones/WebPass.html">http://web.fccj.org/~wcjones/WebPass.html</a></blockquote>
Several vendors of commercial Web servers also offer remote user administration
scripts. See your server documentation for details.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q8"></a>Q8: Using per-directory access control files to control
access to directories is so convenient, why should I use access.conf?</h2>
Instead of placing directory access restrictions directives in centralized
configuration files, most servers give you the ability to control access
by putting a "hidden" file in the directory you want to restrict access
to (this file is called ".htaccess" in NCSA-derived servers and ".www_acl"
in the CERN server). It is very convenient to use these files since you
can adjust the restrictions on a directory without having to edit the central
access control file. There are several problems with relying on .htaccess
files too heavily. One is that with access control files scattered all
over the document hierarchy, there is no central place where the access
policy for the site is clearly set out. Another problem is that it is easy
for these files to get modified or overwritten inadvertently, opening up
a section of the document tree to the public. Finally, there is a bug in
many servers (including the NCSA server) that allows the access control
files to be fetched just like any other file using a URL such as:
<pre>   http://your.site.com/protected/directory/.htaccess</pre>
This is clearly an undesirable feature since it gives out important information
about your system, including the location of the server password file.
<p>Another problem with the per-directory access files is that if you
ever need to change the server software, it's a lot easier to update a
single central access control file than to search and fix a hundred small
files.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q9"></a>Q9: How does encryption work?</h2>
Encryption works by encoding the text of a message with a key. In traditional
encryption systems, the same key was used for both encoding and decoding.
In the new public key or asymmetric encryption systems, keys come in pairs:
one key is used for encoding and another for decoding. In this system everyone
owns a unique pair of keys. One of the keys, called the public key, is
widely distributed and used for encoding messages. The other key, called
the private key, is a closely held secret used to decrypt incoming message.
Under this system, a person who needs to send a message to a second person
can encrypt the message with that person's public key. The message can
only be decrypted by the owner of the secret private key, making it safe
from interception. This system can also be used to create unforgeable digital
signatures.
<p>Most practical implementations of secure Internet encryption actually
combine the traditional symmetric and the new asymmetric schemes. Public
key encryption is used to negotiate a secret symmetric key that is then
used to encrypt the actual data.
<p>Since commercial ventures have a critical need for secure transmission
on the Web, there is very active interest in developing schemes for encrypting
the data that passes between browser and server.
<p>More information on public key cryptography can be found in the book
"Applied Cryptography", by Bruce Schneier.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q10"></a>Q10: What are: SSL, SHTTP, Shen?</h2>
These are all proposed encryption and user authentication standards for
the Web. Each requires the right combination of compatible browser and
server to operate, so none is yet the universal solution to the secure
data transmission problem.
<p><i>SSL</i> (Secure Socket Layer) is the scheme proposed by Netscape
Communications Corporation. It is a low level encryption scheme used to
encrypt transactions in higher-level protocols such as HTTP, NNTP and FTP.
The SSL protocol includes provisions for server authentication (verifying
the server's identity to the client), encryption of data in transit, and
optional client authentication (verifying the client's identity to the
server). SSL is currently implemented commercially on several different
browsers, including Netscape Navigator, Secure Mosaic, and Microsoft Internet
Explorer, and many different servers, including ones from Netscape, Microsoft,
IBM, Quarterdeck, OpenMarket and O'Reilly and Associates. Details on SSL
can be found at:
<p><a href="http://home.netscape.com/products/security/ssl/index.html">http://home.netscape.com/products/security/ssl/index.html</a>
<p><i>SHTTP</i> (Secure HTTP) is the scheme proposed by CommerceNet, a
coalition of businesses interested in developing the Internet for commercial
uses. It is a higher level protocol that only works with the HTTP protocol,
but is potentially more extensible than SSL. Currently SHTTP is implemented
for the Open Marketplace Server marketed by Open Market, Inc on the server
side, and Secure HTTP Mosaic by Enterprise Integration Technologies on
the client side. See here for details:
<p><a href="http://www.eit.com/creations/s-http/">http://www.eit.com/creations/s-http/</a>
<p>Shen is scheme proposed by Phillip Hallam-Baker of CERN. Like SHTTP
it is a high level replacement for the existing HTTP protocol. Although
it has existed as a proposal for nearly two years, no browser or server
vendor has implemented it. Further, the URL that described it is no longer
available, so for all intents and purposes it can be considered moribund.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q11"></a>Q11: Are there any "freeware" secure servers?</h2>
There is a freeware implementation of SSL, known as
<i>SSLeay</i>. This
implementation comes as C source code that can be linked into such applications
as Telnet and FTP. Among the supported applications are the freely redistributable
Unix Web servers Apache and NCSA httpd, and several Unix-based Web browsers,
including Mosaic. Outside United States borders this package can be used
free of charge in both commercial and non-commercial applications. Within
the United States, however, you will need to pay a licensing fee to <a href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA
Data Security</a> in order to use SSL for commercial applications (it might
be easier to obtain one of the commercial versions of Apache-SSL, which
provide the license as part of the purchase price).
<p>There are several components to this software. You will need to obtain
and install them all in order to have a working SSL-based Web server:

You can obtain precompiled versions of Apache-SSL from two sources. Within
the United States you can obtain <a href="http://www.c2.net/">Stronghold</a>
from C2Net Software, Inc.. Outside the United States boundaries, you can
obtain Stronghold from<a href="http://stronghold.ukweb.com/">http://stronghold.ukweb.com/</a>.
This version of Apache is available at a discount for non-profit organizations
and educational institutions.
<p>After installing an SSL-enabled server you will need to obtain a
<i>server
certificate</i> from a certifying authority. Server certificates are available
from a number of different companies, each with a slightly different application
procedure and fee schedule. In the United States, the <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign
Corporation</a> was the first and still most widely used certifying authority.
Because of a recent fee increase ($495 for a commercial server certificate),
however, VeriSign is currently one of the more expensive agencies. A good
alternative to VeriSign is <a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte Consulting</a>;
its fees are significantly lower and its application procedure for non-American
organization is far less of a hassle. Other certifying authorities include:

</dl>
Before obtaining a server certificate from one of these CA's, be sure to
confirm that the certificate will be recognized by the browsers you wish
to support. VeriSign and Thawte and recognized by recent versions of both
the Netscape and Microsoft browsers. Others are less likely to be recognized.
To see a list of certificates honored by the browser, choose <i>Options-&lt;Security
Preferences->Site Certificates</i> in Netscape Navigator, or
<i>View->Options->Security->Sites</i>
in Internet Explorer. The information is available in Netscape Communicator
by pressing the <i>Security</i> button in the toolbar.
<p>The process of obtaining a server certificate is slightly different
from CA to CA, but follows the same basic outline. After choosing a certifying
authority, connect to its Web site and find the server certificate application
section. From here locate the appropriate application form for your server
software, and fill it out. You'll be asked to provide your Web site's domain
name, company name, and contact information. You'll also be asked to provide
documentation, such as a Dun and Bradstreet number, articles of incorporation,
or a notarized letter from the bursar of your college to prove the identity
of your organization. You'll also be asked to provide payment information,
such as a credit card number.
<p>The application form is only half of the process. You'll also need to
generate an electronic certificate request. After submitting the application
form to the CA, you'll use a program provided with your server software
to generate a public/private key pair. In the Apache-SSL distributions,
the program is called<i>genkey</i>.
<p>After generating the key pair, the key generation software will create
a file containing the key request. In some cases it will automatically
mail the file to the CA. In other cases, it will ask you to manually mail
the file to the CA. In either case there will now be a wait of days to
weeks while the CA confirms the validity of your request. Eventually you
will receive a signed certificate by return e-mail. You then complete the
process by installing the signed certificate on your server. The details
again vary from server to server. For Apache-SSL you'll use a program called
<i>getca</i>.
<p>At this point users will be able to retrieve documents from your server
and to submit forms without fear of interception. Your server's certificate
provides remote users with proof of your server's identity.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q12"></a>Q12: Can I use Personal Certificates to Control Server
Access?</h2>
SSL can also be used to verify the <i>users'</i> identity to the server,
providing more reliable authentication than the common password-based authentication
schemes. To take advantage of this system each user will have to obtain
a "personal certificate" from a CA.
<p>Users can obtain inexpensive personal certificates from <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a>.
VeriSign offers two classes of certificate. Class 1 certificates cost a
mere $9.95 yearly, but provide no assurance that the user is who he or
she claims to be because VeriSign performs no validation of the information
submitted by the user on the application form. At most, class 1 certificates
certify that the user can receive e-mail at the address provided in the
application. Class 2 certificates, available for $19.95 yearly, provide
a greater level of assurance. In order to obtain such a certificate, the
user must provide personal identifying information that is validated by
a credit bureau.
<p>If you are running an intranet, you may wish to issue personal certificates
yourself, in order to provide fine-grained access control to employees
of your organization. To do this, you will need to obtain and install a
certificate server. Such systems are available from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>,
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>,
<a href="http://www.xcert.com/">XCert</a>,
<a href="http://www.entrust.com/">Entrust</a>
and <a href="http://www.cybertrust.gte.com/">GTE</a>.
<p>To use personal certificates for access control, your server will need
to be specially configured. The mechanics of setting this up are beyond
the scope of this document, but detailed directions can be found in the
author's book, <i>Web Security: A Step-by-Step Reference Guide</i>.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q13"></a>Q13: How do I accept credit card orders over the Web?</h2>
You can always instruct users to call your 800 number :-). Seriously, though,
you _shouldn't_ ask remote users to submit their credit card number in
a fill-out form field unless you are using an encrypting server/browser
combination. Your alternate is to use one of the credit card proxy systems
described in the <a href="#Q30">next section</a>.
<p>Even with an encrypting server, you should be careful about what happens
to the credit card number <b>after</b> it's received by the server. For
example, if the number is received by a server script, make sure not to
write it out to a world-readable log file or send it via e-mail to a remote
site.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="CON-Q14"></a>Q14: What are: CyberCash, SET, OpenMarket?</h2>
These are all schemes that have been developed to process commercial transactions
over the Web without compromising credit card numbers or other confidential
information.
<h3>
CyberCash</h3>
<i>CyberCash</i>, a product of the CyberCash Corporation, uses specialized
software on the merchant and customer's sides of the connections to provide
for secure payments across the Internet. CyberCash supports both credit
cards and electronic checks. The credit card service enables online stores
and Internet billers to accept credit card payments for goods or services
and the "PayNow" service enables Internet billers to accept electronic
check payments for bills presented on the Internet.  For a consumer
or business to make CyberCash payments, they submit credit card or checking
account information via an SSL-enabled form provided by the merchant.
Alternatively, the consumer may use an <a href="http://www.instabuy.com">InstaBuy</a>
Wallet to simplify the purchasing process. InstaBuy saves user credit card
information (electronic checks are not yet supported), in 128-bit encrypted
form, on the InstaBuy servers.
<p>When a user goes to purchase an item from a CyberCash enrolled merchant,
the user fills out a traditional payment form to be submitted via SSL,
or, if the merchant also supports InstaBuy, clicks on the InstaBuy icon
to to set up or use a Wallet.  CyberCash merchants may choose whether
or not to implement InstaBuy, which is a new service owned by CyberCash.
Payment information is then sent to the merchant's web server which packages
the transaction for forwarding to the CyberCash Gateway servers, which
are linked to financial institutions. CyberCash, in contrast to the associations
created by its name, is really a back-end payment system, transparent to
the user, which merchants use for payment processing.
<p>An advantage of CyberCash is its use of triple-DES encryption when transmitting
payment information.  Also, because payments are processed entirely
by CyberCash, there is really no need for merchants to record credit card
or checking account information in a database or other static memory location.
This lessens the merchant's risk that financial information can be stolen
by individuals who have broken into the merchant's computer system.
The onus is on CyberCash to handle all security concerns.
<p>For merchants to accept CyberCash payments they must first establish
a credit card merchant account with an acquiring financial institution.
More than 95 percent of the acquiring financial institutions in the United
States are CyberCash-enabled. Fees to open merchant accounts vary, as they
are set by the regional banks themselves.  A typical scenario would
include: a one-time fee of approximately $100 to create the account, a
monthly fee of approximately $15 to keep the account open, and a transaction
fee of 2-3% of the purchase price of each transaction.  In addition
to fees charged by the acquiring financial institution, CyberCash says
that merchants should expect to pay (to CyberCash) a one-time service setup
fee ($500 to $1,000), and monthly service fees typically comprised of a
service access fee (usually $40 - $80) and transaction charges based on
volume (usually $0.20 to $0.60 per  transaction).
<p>After setting up a merchant bank account, the merchant must install
software called the "Merchant Connection Kit" (MCK) on their Web server.
This software is launched when the user presses the "pay" button in a shopping
cart script (or equivalent), and forwards the transaction to the "CashRegister"
service running on the CyberCash servers. The MCK is downloadable free
of charge and available for many platforms, including Windows NT and Unix.
It requires only 100k of hard disk space, and consists of encryption and
communication libraries, HTML templates, and CGI scripts for handling payments
at your online store.
<p>The MCK's job is to transmit all payment information to the CyberCash
Gateway servers, which are responsible for executing the transaction.
These are  payment servers which communicate with financial institutions
in such a way that, to the financial institution, the transactions look
like standard point of sale events, not internet transactions.
<p>CyberCash also offers an "Administrative Interface", which is a web
site that enables you to perform administrative tasks such as querying
for transactions, getting daily transaction totals, or refunding money
for returned items.
<p>The main advantage of CyberCash is that it provides the merchant with
a fully functional, externally managed payment processing system. The merchant
need only set up a merchant account and configure the MCK to get started.
Disadvantages include the risk of centralizing so much financial information
on one server system (CyberCash), and the accompanying dependence on the
CyberCash servers' performance and throughput characteristics. In addition,
the fees charged to merchants for processing credit card transactions make
CyberCash impractical for small purchases, such as "pay per play" on-line
video games.

<h3>
SET</h3>
SET, or <i>Secure Electronic Transaction</i> protocol, is an open standard
for processing of credit card transactions over the Internet created jointly
by Netscape, Microsoft, Visa and Mastercard. The main justification for
SET is interoperability. By adhering to the standard, one vendor's software
will be interoperable with any other vendor's software.
<p>To address the high potential for fraud on the Internet, the SET standard
uses a complex system of certifying authorities to vouch for the identify
of every party in the transaction: customer, merchant, card-issuer and
merchant's bank are all identified by signed, unforgeable certificates.
To address privacy concerns, the transaction is separated in such a way
that the merchant has access to information about what is being purchased,
how much it costs, and whether the payment is approved, but no information
on what payment method the customer is using. Similarly, the card-issuer
has access to the purchase price, but no information on the type of merchandise
involved. Despite these precautions, however, SET does not provide complete
anonymity to the consumer.
<p>SET requires specialized software on both the customer's and merchant's
side of the connection. Cardholders shopping on SET-compliant sites who
want to take advantage of secure SET processing must have a SET compliant
wallet, available from SET merchants or financial institutions. Some merchants
may also require that the cardholder have a SET Certificate. The main advantages
of SET to the consumer are security guaranteed by digital certificates,
and the ability to utilize the same wallet, theoretically, on any SET-compliant
site.
<p>Merchant's who wish to become a SET online merchant site need to build
or purchase a SET-compliant merchant server product.  The SET website
provides a <a href="http://www.setco.org/cgi-bin/vsm.cgi">Vendor Status
Matrix</a> with information about purchasing and installing merchant server
applications. Merchants then need to contact their financial institution
to obtain a digital certificate.
<p>Microsoft offers Site Server Commerce Edition, a superset of the Microsoft
Site Server server product, which is itself a superset of Internet Information
Server. Site Server Commerce Edition supports real-time credit authorization
with SET. It also includes all of Site Server's features for dynamically
publishing content, searching content and the delivery of content in multiple
formats. For more information on Site Server Commerce, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/siteserver/commerce/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/siteserver/commerce/default.htm</a>.
<p>For its part, the iPlanet.com collaboration of Netscape Corporation
and Sun Microsystems, offers <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/ecommerce/merchantxpert/merchantxpert.html">MerchantXPert</a>
which provides catalog management, order management, membership services,
and payment services. While Netscape's earlier e-commerce merchant server
product, LivePayment, was moving in the direction of full SET compliance,
the new offering from the Alliance is not SET-compliant and does not appear
to be headed in that direction.
<p>For more information on SET, see the <a href="http://www.setco.org/">Secure
Electronic Transaction LLC</a> website. They are responsible for the ongoing
management of the SET specification.
<h3>
Open Market Web Commerce System</h3>
Open Market, Inc., also offers an online commerce system. In the Open Market
scheme, a back-end transaction system and a front-end catalog interface
to create an end to end e-commerce solution. The back-end system, known
